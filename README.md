# MyAtemptAtVic2MarketSimulation
 
So i atempted to create an economy simulation for vic2.
I Failed but:

The economy sort of work prices fall prices rise.
RGO system works somewhat (they produce shit pay they workers and aristocrats)
but i implemented a las time bug where pops flagged unenployed.

The artisans nearly work i just have to figure out some logic
(how much of ther money artisan pops spend on goods for consumpcion and producion)
(And idk why but artisans gets deleted :|)

I dont even atempt to finish factorys to deadline.

Yeh this project is a mess but may finish it someday.

in the Simulacion class ther is an example how to start things.
in the main you can decide how much iteracion this will run.

PLEASE ROAST MY SHITTY CODE SO I CAN LEARN FROM THIS

Thx
